I'm a developer from Glasgow, who's been in the industry for 7 years.

Current areas of interest:

    * Distributed Systems
    * Infrastructure Automation
    * Continuous Delivery and Automated Deployment
    * Linux/UNIX
    * Open Source
    * Web Development
    * TDD

I spent the first 6 years of my career exclusively in Microsoft related development, namely C# and .NET. About a year ago, I started becoming heavily interested in Linux. At the time, I was working on a .NET project, but we were increasingly pursuing using Linux based infrastructure, which really opened my eyes to what else was available. You tend to become a bit myopic when you spend _all_ your time on one platform. So for the past year, most of my interest and focus has really been in the Linux/UNIX based direction.

I'm going to try and blog regularly, and I'm just going to write about anything that's interesting to me, even if it's already been covered by someone else. I can document my own learning experiences and perhaps add my own little twists to the subjects. Plus, it'll increase my career prospects :).
